# Definition of the capability used by the device created to indicate zoom presence status
# The capability has two attributes. The presenceStatus attribute reflects the user's status
# as defined by Zoom. The inProgress attribute is derived from the presence status and simply
# indicates whether the user is in a meeting or not. It's there to make creating automations
# easier, since they don't need to account for all the possible presence values.

# Defines the device profile and device configuration for the Zoom presence status device.
# Note that this shorthand format is supported by the SmartThings CLI but not directly by the
# APIs, which have separate endpoints for device profiles and devivce configurations. In this
# shorthand format the device configuration definition is provided in the "view" property.
# Creating or updating a device using this format automatically creates device profile and
# device configuration object, and sets the presentationId of the device profile to the associated
# device configuration
